# Leetcode Solutions
One of my hobbies is solving algorithm problems, especially those on [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/). Not only it is fun to solve a puzzle but also it helps me to improve my fundamental knowledge and programming skills. So I decided to create this repository to record my solutions. I will try to solve the problems using two programming languages:
- Python
- Java

**_NOTE:_** I'll try to solve one problem a day and update the repo, but no promises. After all, life is unpredictable and not everything is about programming! Also I'm not going to solve them respectively, but I keep the problem index as it is in Leetcode.

These solutions are definitely not flawless so, I'd be grateful if you could see any problems in my solutions and point them out.  
Also if you are looking for the best solutions there are many repositories out there that you can use, like [This One](https://github.com/doocs/leetcode)
