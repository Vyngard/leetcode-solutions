# [2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers)

## Description

<p>You are given two <strong>non-empty</strong> linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in <strong>reverse order</strong>, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum&nbsp;as a linked list.</p>

<p>You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
<strong>Output:</strong> [7,0,8]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 342 + 465 = 807.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
<strong>Output:</strong> [0]
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
<strong>Output:</strong> [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
</pre>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range <code>[1, 100]</code>.</li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= Node.val &lt;= 9</code></li>
	<li>It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.</li>
</ul>


## Solution
In here we traverse the two linked lists at the same time and add the values of the nodes to each other and save the result in a new LinkedList. If the `sum` is greater than 10, we add 1 to the next `sum` (save it as `carry`).   
If one of the linked lists is longer than the other, we add the rest of the longer linked list to the `sum`. We keep doing this until we reach the end of both linked lists and we don't have any `carry` left.   
Then we return the new LinkedList `from the second node`, since the first one is 0 and it shouldn't be in our calculation.   
The time complexity is O(max(m,n)), in which m and n are the lengths of the inputs. Since we have to traverse the longer LinkedList anyway, the time complexity is depandant on that.
