# [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs)

## Description

<p>You are climbing a staircase. It takes <code>n</code> steps to reach the top.</p>

<p>Each time you can either climb <code>1</code> or <code>2</code> steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
</pre>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= n &lt;= 45</code></li>
</ul>

## Solutions
1) (provided in Python code): the solution is like Fibonacci sequence, so we can use recursion to solve it. However, the time complexity is O(2^n), which is not efficient.      
2) (provided in Java code): So we can use dynamic programming to solve it. actually the name is terrfying but it is a simple while loop. The time complexity is O(n) and the space complexity is O(n).
